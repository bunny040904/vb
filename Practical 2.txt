Practical 2

. Create the following tables .And Solve following queries by SQL
 Deposit (actno,cname,bname,amount,adate) 
 Branch (bname,city)
 Customers (cname, city)
 Borrow(loanno,cname,bname, amount)
- Add primary key and foreign key wherever applicable.
- Insert data into the above created tables.
Perform the following queries:
1. Display names of depositors having amount greater than 4000.
2. Display account date of customers Anil
3. Display account no. and deposit amount of customers having account opened between 
dates1-12-96 and 1-5-97
4. Find the names of all branches where the average account balance is more than 1,200.
5. Delete depositors having deposit less than 5000
6. Create a view on deposit table

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Create Customers table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    cname VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create Branch table
CREATE TABLE Branch (
    bname VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create Deposit table with foreign keys referencing Customers and Branch
CREATE TABLE Deposit (
    actno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cname VARCHAR(50),
    bname VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    adate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES Customers(cname),
    FOREIGN KEY (bname) REFERENCES Branch(bname)
);

-- Create Borrow table with foreign keys referencing Customers and Branch
CREATE TABLE Borrow (
    loanno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cname VARCHAR(50),
    bname VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES Customers(cname),
    FOREIGN KEY (bname) REFERENCES Branch(bname)
);


-- Insert data into Branch table
INSERT INTO Branch (bname, city) VALUES ('Main', 'CityA');
INSERT INTO Branch (bname, city) VALUES ('North', 'CityB');
INSERT INTO Branch (bname, city) VALUES ('South', 'CityC');

-- Insert data into Customers table
INSERT INTO Customers (cname, city) VALUES ('Anil', 'CityA');
INSERT INTO Customers (cname, city) VALUES ('Sunita', 'CityB');
INSERT INTO Customers (cname, city) VALUES ('Raj', 'CityC');

-- Insert data into Deposit table
INSERT INTO Deposit (actno, cname, bname, amount, adate) VALUES (1001, 'Anil', 'Main', 5000.00, '1997-01-10');
INSERT INTO Deposit (actno, cname, bname, amount, adate) VALUES (1002, 'Sunita', 'North', 3000.00, '1996-12-05');
INSERT INTO Deposit (actno, cname, bname, amount, adate) VALUES (1003, 'Raj', 'South', 4500.00, '1996-11-25');

-- Insert data into Borrow table
INSERT INTO Borrow (loanno, cname, bname, amount) VALUES (2001, 'Anil', 'Main', 2000.00);
INSERT INTO Borrow (loanno, cname, bname, amount) VALUES (2002, 'Sunita', 'North', 1500.00);
INSERT INTO Borrow (loanno, cname, bname, amount) VALUES (2003, 'Raj', 'South', 2500.00);

----Perform Queries

1. Display names of depositors having an amount greater than 4000.

SELECT cname 
FROM Deposit 
WHERE amount > 4000;


2. Display the account date of customer Anil.

SELECT adate 
FROM Deposit 
WHERE cname = 'Anil';


3. Display account number and deposit amount of customers with accounts opened between 1-12-96 and 1-5-97.

SELECT actno, amount 
FROM Deposit 
WHERE adate BETWEEN '1996-12-01' AND '1997-05-01';


4. Find the names of all branches where the average account balance is more than 1200.

SELECT bname 
FROM Deposit 
GROUP BY bname 
HAVING AVG(amount) > 1200;


5. Delete depositors having deposits less than 5000.

DELETE FROM Deposit 
WHERE amount < 5000;


6. Create a view on the Deposit table.

CREATE VIEW DepositView AS
SELECT actno, cname, bname, amount, adate 
FROM Deposit;
